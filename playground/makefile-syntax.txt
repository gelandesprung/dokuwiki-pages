======Functions for Transforming Text======
Functions allow you to do text processing in the makefile to compute the files to operate on or the commands to use in recipes. You use a function in a function call, where you give the name of the function and some text (the arguments) for the function to operate on. The result of the function's processing is substituted into the makefile at the point of the call, just as a variable might be substituted.
