======Functions for Conditionals======

There are three functions that provide conditional expansion. A key aspect((aspect *['æspekt] n. 外观, 方面, 面貌, 方向)) of these functions is that not all of the arguments are expanded initially((initially *[i'niʃәli] ad. 最初, 开头)). Only those arguments which need to be expanded, will be expanded.

====$(if condition,then-part[,else-part])====
The if function provides support for conditional expansion in a functional context (as opposed((opposed *[ә'pәuzd] a. 反对的, 敌对的, 对抗的, 相对的)) to the GNU make makefile conditionals such as ifeq (see Syntax of Conditionals).

The first argument, condition, first has all preceding and trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded. If it expands to any non-empty string, then the condition is considered to be true. If it expands to an empty string, the condition is considered to be false.

If the condition is true then the second argument, then-part, is evaluated((evaluate *[i'væljueit] vt. 评估, 评价, 赋值)) and this is used as the result of the evaluation of the entire if function.

If the condition is false then the third argument, else-part, is evaluated and this is the result of the if function. If there is no third argument, the if function evaluates to nothing (the empty string).

Note that only one of the then-part or the else-part will be evaluated, never both. Thus, either can contain side-effects (such as shell function calls, etc.)
====$(or condition1[,condition2[,condition3...]])====
The or function provides a “short-circuiting” OR operation. Each argument is expanded, in order. If an argument expands to a non-empty string the processing stops and the result of the expansion is that string. If, after all arguments are expanded, all of them are false (empty), then the result of the expansion is the empty string.
====$(and condition1[,condition2[,condition3...]])====
The and function provides a “short-circuiting” AND operation. Each argument is expanded, in order. If an argument expands to an empty string the processing stops and the result of the expansion is the empty string. If all arguments expand to a non-empty string then the result of the expansion is the expansion of the last argument.
